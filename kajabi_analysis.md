## Critical Discovery: Branded App 📱

**This is HUGE!** Mia mentioned she has an app in the App Store and Google Play. This is likely built through Kajabi's Branded App feature.

**What this means:**
- Kajabi can be the **central hub** for everything
- No need for Glide app (can migrate to Kajabi app)
- No need for InControl (Kajabi handles courses)
- No need for separate landing page tools
