## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive implementation plan for Mia Ben Efraim to launch and scale a new, highly profitable business inspired by the successful model of Maria Wendt, while leveraging Mia's unique expertise as a clinical dietitian and her established presence in the Israeli market. The plan is designed to be executed in four distinct phases over a 24-month period, with the ultimate goal of achieving significant revenue growth, audience expansion, and market leadership in the women's health and wellness space in Israel and beyond.
