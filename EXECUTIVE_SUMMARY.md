## Conclusion: The Path to ₪1M+/Month

Mia Ben Efraim has everything needed to build a ₪1M+/month digital product business:

✅ **Assets:** 248 videos, 26,823 subscribers, 1,000+ students  
✅ **Authority:** Clinical dietitian, 51K Instagram followers  
✅ **Audience:** Engaged community with proven buying behavior  
✅ **Blueprint:** Maria Wendt's $15M model adapted to Hebrew market  
✅ **Safety Net:** Existing ₪558K/month revenue  

**The only thing missing: Execution.**

This 90-day plan provides the exact roadmap to:
- Add ₪300,000/month in passive revenue (90 days)
- Scale to ₪500,000/month (6 months)
- Reach ₪800,000/month (12 months)
- Build a ₪10M+/year business (18-24 months)

**Total addressable market:** Hebrew-speaking women (Israel + diaspora) = 3-4 million potential customers
